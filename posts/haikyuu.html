<h1>Haikyuu</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Haikyuu (ハイキュー!!) is a manga/anime about a Japanese high-school volleyball team, Karasuno, that fights their way to nationals. From Wikipedia: “The story follows Shōyō Hinata, a boy determined to become a great volleyball player despite his small stature.” However, the story goes beyond just Hinata to explore many of the characters in depth.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>[ spoiler warning from here on out ]</p>

<p>The first time I ever watched Haikyuu was my freshman year of high school, where I watched the first season and half of the second season before stopping. This was around after I finished Kuroko no Basuke, and at the time, I thought Haikyuu was more “boring” since it lacked any super cool, “epic” powers/characters in general. However, when I rewatched it my senior year of high school, I was blown away by the details and how realistic and humbling this anime is. [Spoiler Warning] When Karasuno lost its last match against Aoba Johsai in season 1, I was shocked; I feel like most anime have cliche endings, and you rarely see the main character(s) losing in important battles. I think as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to appreciate less “flashy” things (which I used to look up to a lot as a kid) and instead the beauty of the ordinary. Haikyuu displays this really well– no character is perfect at everything, each character makes mistakes, and as you watch, you feel like you’re growing right alongside the characters.</p>

<p>Something I love about Haikyuu is how you grow to love each of the characters. The characters are (mostly) all really well-written, with varying personality traits, strengths, and flaws, just like real life. This is a pretty big contrast to Kuroko no Basuke, where only one or two people stand out from each team (including the main team!). In Haikyuu, basically any character could be someone’s favorite character from the series without raising any eyebrows. This anime is written such that when a match ends, you end up happy for the winning team but sad for the other team.</p>

<p>Overall, Haikyuu has been such a heartwarming, humbling, exciting, and realistic story to follow along. Haikyuu is one of my personal favorite animes of all time.</p>
